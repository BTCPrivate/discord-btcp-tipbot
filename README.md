# discord-btcp-tipbot

Discord bot for tipping with Bitcoin Private

rename config_sample.json to config.json and place valid discord auth token inside config.json along with config info for the node (ipaddress, port, rpcusername, rpcpassword)

Initial way this was setup and tested was on a server with access to the full node daemon, and uses ( node-altcoin ) to interact with the daemon via RPC.
